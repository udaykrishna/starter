# **Starter**
### Application :bowtie:
This project is for people like me who prefer to create files in their desktop folder and as a result endup making their desktop very messy. this application helps to organize the files by merging the files into one file and moving it into logs folder within the same folder.

Currently only works for text files as merging process of other files is yet to be planned, labeling the files and having a gui for the task is a more bigger concern right now so the project will move in this direction for now.

The usage arguments has been written very loosely and is bound to change and improve as the project goes further. 

> hope this piece of code saves you some time (try running this at startup automatically to help you better)

### Usage
```bash
java App "path-to-files" [list extensions of files to be organised] 
```
1. Note that one needs to have JRE installed to run this.
2. Just download the files in the bin folder and run using command line with arguments as mentioned above
